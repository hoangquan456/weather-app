# Weather Web App
This is a **Weather Web Application** built using **vanilla JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**, with **no frameworks** involved. The app makes **API calls** to retrieve weather data and display it to the user. The entire application is client-side, with all the logic and data handling performed in the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the web page and create the layout.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web page and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Used for the logic of the app, including making API calls, processing data, and updating the DOM.
- **Webpack**: Used to bundle and optimize the code, including modules and assets.
- **API**: Fetches weather data from a third-party API (e.g., Visual Crossing API).

## Setup
1. **Install the dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```
2. **Run the development server**: After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the app:
```bash
npm run start
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: In the future, I plan to integrate a backend to handle user authentication, save preferences, and store historical weather data.
